Ethereum Solidity local node testing with security features for Visual Studio Code.

Develop, test, and secure Solidity smart contracts directly in Visual Studio Code with real-time security analysis, local node testing, and advanced debugging tools. Solidity (Wake) brings a Remix-like experience to your existing workflow with tools for compilation, deployment, and contract interaction on a local Ethereum network. Catch security risks early with built-in vulnerability detection, call graphs, and contract inheritance visualization without leaving VS Code.

This extension was built by a leading blockchain auditing firm that has worked with Lido, AAVE, Axelar, Safe, LayerZero, and more. It was developed for our professional needs and made open-source for a safer web3.

## Test and interact with your smart contracts on an Ethereum local node

### Compile and deploy contracts

Compile your contracts and deploy them on a local chain for testing

![Compile and deploy contracts](images/readme/sake/1-compile-deploy.gif)

### Interact with contracts

Test your deployed contracts by interacting with them using function calls with different inputs

![Interact with contracts](images/readme/sake/2-interact.gif)

### Fork mainnet or L2s to interact with onchain contracts

## Requirements

The Solidity extension uses the PyPi package [eth-wake](https://pypi.org/project/eth-wake/) which requires Python 3.8 or higher. This package is automatically installed via [conda](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/) by default.

Rosetta is required to be enabled on Apple Silicon Macs.

## Known Issues

- **`Go to references`, number of references and other features do not work correctly with no workspace open**

It is always recommended to open a project as a folder (`File -> Open folder`). `Open file` should only be used when opening a single file or several files inside the same folder.

- **Analysis does not work when the workspace contains compilation errors**

The extension relies on the `solc` compiler. For this reason, files containing compilation errors and files importing these files cannot be analyzed.
